The Spanish Inquisition lives on in the popular imagination more than five
hundred years after it was established in 1478. Monty Python taught us no
one expected it. Mel Brooks turned it into a song. This dark humor worked
to de-fang an institution associated with the worst impulses of religious
intolerance and persecution. This course will look at the long history of
the Spanish Inquisition on the Iberian peninsula and in the Americas to go
beyond secret trails, torture, and autos-da-fe to understand why the
Inquisition was established, its institutional role was in Spanish rule,
and its legacies for the modern world.

# policies {#history}

![](http://chadblack.net/511S2012/media/images/disability.png) Qualified
students with disabilities needing appropriate academic adjustments should
contact me as soon as possible to ensure that your needs are met in a timely
manner with appropriate documentation.

**Attendance:** Attendance at all class sessions is mandatory. If you will not be able to attend
class, please contact me ahead of time.

**Deadlines:** Assignments must be turned to the instructor no later than the
end of class on the day they are due, or at some other specified time
established by the professor. Late papers will not be accepted
for any reason without prior arrangement. This includes technology problems.

**Cell Phones and Laptops:** Please silence our cell phones prior to class.
Please do not text during class. Laptops are allowed only for tasks
related to this class. Distracting use of technology (social media,
surfing, etc.) causes problems not only for your own learning, but for
those around you. Research shows that analog notetaking improves learning.
Consider having paper with you. Based on the prevailing
literature, hand note-taking-- both while reading and in class-- leads to
substantially better educational outcomes. You are not required to have a laptop
in class, so feel free to leave it at home. If, however, you have compelling reasons to use
your laptop for notetaking, I won't stop you from doing so.

**Office Hours**: Students are strongly encouraged to speak with me outside of
class. The advantages of talking with me include: extra help on an assignment
or preparation for an exam; clarification of materials covered in lecture,
discussion of my comments on your work; discussion of this or related courses.
I am available during office hours on a first-come, first-served basis; if you
cannot come by during office hours, please contact me via email or phone and I
will be happy to set up an appointment with you.

**Changes:** I reserve the write to change this syllabus as the semester
progresses. This is not a contract, but rather a document to guide expectations
and clearly communicate weekly assignments. Please bring the syllabus with you
to our class meetings. Or, keep up with it on the course website.
