title: "Oversight Committee as Inquisition"

Over the course of the semester, I encourage you to watch for uses of
'inquisition' as metaphor in our current age. Here's an example. Five days ago,
when Represenative Darrell Issa (R) announced he would not run again for his
Congressional seat in California, the New York Times included this observation
in their
[coverage](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/us/politics/darrell-issa-retirement.html?_r=0):

>  The founder of a successful car-alarm company, Mr. Issa is one of Congressâ€™s wealthiest members. But he became best known in Washington for turning the Oversight Committee into something like an Inquisition. He appeared to relish the role.

What work is Inquisition doing in this paragraph?
