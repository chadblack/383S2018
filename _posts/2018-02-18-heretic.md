title: "Carlton Pearson and the Politics of Hell"

A couple of weeks ago when we were discussing *alumbradismo* and the
lutheranite heresies, I mentioned an episode of **This American Life** that
dealt with the fall of Carlton Pearson. Pearson is a pastor, who came to doubt
the existence of hell and changed his theology of salvation. His universalism
got him branded a modern day heretic by the denomination he worked under. The
episode tells that story, which is very compelling in light of the kinds of
questions that Inquisitors were asked of 16th-century "heretics."

You can listen to the episode on the [This American Life episode
page](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/304/heretics). And I would encourage you
to do so, to see modern ways that orthodoxy gets dealt with.
