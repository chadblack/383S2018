As we rapidly approach our first day of class in the Spring 2018 season,
I'm frantically putting the final touches on the course syllabus and
website. In addition to the site, a pdf version of the syllabus is
available [here](images/syllabus.pdf), in case you prefer it in that form.
I will also hand out paper copies on Thursday. I'm looking forward to an
engaging semester of inquisitorial intrigue!
