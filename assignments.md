# Assignments {#history}

1. **Reading Memos** (30%)
   
   For each assigned secondary reading, students must write
   a research memo to be turned in on the day that reading is assigned.
   Instructions for how to write a research memo are available
   [here](http://chadblack.net/499F2017/img/precis-memo.pdf).


2. **Book Review** (20%)
   
   Each student will write a formal review paper of James Wadsworth,
   *Agents of Orthodoxy*. This book is on the Inquisition in Brazil,
   and your review should extend the normal research memo to a review
   that compares Wadsworth's portrayal of the Inquisition in
   Pernambuco to New Spain. **DUE: ** 

3. **Midterm and Final Exams** (20% each)
   
   There will be two in class exams consisting of short answer and
   essay questions. You may bring printed copies of your reading
   memos to aid in your exams.

4. **Trial Discussions** (10%)
   
   Most Thursdays, we will be reading and analyzing cases to
   understand what Inquisition sources offer the modern historian.
   Your participation in those discussions will determine this part of
   your grade.
